Imagine you have a big toy box called AuthContextProvider. Inside this toy box, there are some special toys that everyone wants to play with. These special toys are the currentStep value and the setCurrentStep function.

Now, let's say you have a bunch of different games (components) that all want to play with these special toys. Instead of giving each game a separate copy of the toys, you can use the useAuthContext hook to share the toys with all the games.

When a game (component) wants to play with the special toys, it calls the useAuthContext hook.

It's like the game is saying, "Hey, can I have those special toys from the big toy box?"
Inside the useAuthContext hook, there's a special line that says const state = React.useContext(authContext);.

This is like the hook going to the big toy box (AuthContextProvider) and asking for the special toys.
The authContext is like a secret code that tells the hook where to find the toy box.
Once the hook gets the special toys (the currentStep value and the setCurrentStep function), it puts them in a bag called state.

This state bag contains all the toys that the game (component) needs to play with.
Finally, the hook returns the state bag to the game (component) that asked for it.

It's like the hook saying, "Here you go! Here are the special toys you wanted to play with."
Now, whenever a game (component) calls the useAuthContext hook, it will receive the state bag containing the currentStep value and the setCurrentStep function. This means that all the games (components) can share and play with the same toys, without having to worry about getting their own copies.

The AuthContextProvider component acts as the big toy box that holds all the special toys, and the useAuthContext hook is like a special helper that allows the games (components) to easily access and play with those toys.

JAVA COMPARISON 

The concept of using the AuthContextProvider component and the useAuthContext hook in React is similar to a design pattern in Java called the "Singleton pattern" combined with the "Dependency Injection" principle. While it's not exactly the same as polymorphism, there are some similarities in terms of providing a centralized way to access and share data.

In Java, the Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is similar to how the AuthContextProvider component acts as a single source of truth for the currentStep value and the setCurrentStep function.

Dependency Injection, on the other hand, is a principle where the dependencies of a class are provided externally rather than being created inside the class itself. This is similar to how the useAuthContext hook allows components to "inject" the currentStep value and the setCurrentStep function into themselves, without having to create or manage those values directly.

Let's compare it to a real-life example to make it easier to understand:

Imagine you have a toy car that needs batteries to run. The batteries are like the currentStep value and the setCurrentStep function in our React example. Instead of each toy car having its own set of batteries, you have a special battery pack (AuthContextProvider) that holds the batteries and provides them to all the toy cars.

Now, when a toy car needs batteries to run, it can use a special cable (useAuthContext hook) to connect to the battery pack and get the batteries it needs. This way, all the toy cars can share the same set of batteries without having to worry about managing their own batteries.

In Java, you might have a BatteryPack class (similar to AuthContextProvider) that holds the batteries and provides methods to access them. Then, you can have a ToyCarBattery class (similar to useAuthContext) that knows how to connect to the BatteryPack and get the batteries.

So, while the concept of using AuthContextProvider and useAuthContext in React is not exactly the same as polymorphism in Java, it shares similarities with the Singleton pattern and Dependency Injection principle in terms of providing a centralized way to manage and share data among different parts of the application.
